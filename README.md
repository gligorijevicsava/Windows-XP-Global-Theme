How to apply the Firefox theme: 

Open Firefox.
In the address bar, type about:config, then press enter.
Press "Accept the Risk and Continue".
In the search bar, search toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets, and make sure it's set as "true".
Download the source code, as a .zip file, by clicking the obvious green button that says "<> Code", and pressing "Download ZIP".
Find the Location where the .zip file is downloaded, then extract it. 
Copy the "chrome" folder.
In Firefox, in the search bar, type about:profiles, and press enter.

Bellow the "default-release, there should be a Root Directory path. Press Open Directory.
Paste the "chrome" folder.

For better compatibility, I put multiple icon packs.

How to apply the Icon Pack(s):

Extract the Icons.7z file. You should have a folder named "icons".
Copy the contents of the "icons" folder.
(Replace $USER with your user):
Paste the contents in the next path: /home/$USER/.local/share/icons/
From System Settings, Apply the "Windows XP" icon pack.
